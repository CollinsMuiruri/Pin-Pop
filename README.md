# Pin-Pop
A project where a single input is manipulated to give various answers.
It has been made using jQuery and css and written with html code.
It takes an input number and divides all numbers before it(including itself) and divides them by 5, 3, or 15.
It then gives out the numbers according to its divisibility.
If a number is divisible by 3 it gives out ping.
If a number is divisible by 5 it gives out pong.
If a number is divisible by 15 it gives out ping pong.
The number is supposed to be input in the white space bar indicated.
Any extra information required for the app is seen on the menu on the top left where there is an about section.
The numbers appear in a box where one can scroll so that you can reach any required number quickly.
Works on any browser.
